# US Naturalization Civics Test
Chrome extension for US Naturalization Civics Test practice.


The interview is coming up pretty fast, so decided to make something for it. 

When the correct answer is submitted, it will be removed from the question list. Option page has reset quesation button. 

If you can't answer and want to see the correct answers, push give up button and try to memorise, then move onto the next question. 

100Q.js is storing the questions in an array. Modify questions as needed. 

if you ever decided to use this, good luck with the test! Let me know if find any bugs.
